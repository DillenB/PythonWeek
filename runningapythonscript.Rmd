# Introduction

### Launch osgeo live from vmware viewer, login.
### How to start Python via the terminal.
### Open the python script within the editor.

# Run the pointbuffer.py script

Below we will explain step by step what is done is the python script so that you
can work on the script from home.
```{r, engine='python'}
from osgeo import ogr
from osgeo import osr

# Create a point geometry
wkt = "POINT (173914.00 441864.00)"

print(pt)
```

# More info about creating a markdown document in Rstudio via R
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Handling Vector data with Python

## GDAL/OGR using Python

By now you should now what the following abbreviation stand for (what can you do with it??).
Osgeo Python module groups 3 submodules:

* GDAL
* OGR

New: 
* OSR: spatial reference (projections!)

Documentation: 

* http://gdal.org/python/
* http://www.gdal.org/gdal_tutorial.html

Check out these relevant books:
* http://geospatialpython.com/

## OGR and the data drivers

OGR supports many different vector formats:

* ESRI formats such as shapefiles, personal geodatabases and ArcSDE
* Other software such as MapInfo, GRASS, Microstation
* Open formats such TIGER/Line, SDTS, GML, KML
* Databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Spatial, etc.

**OGR Data drivers:** A driver is an object that knows how to interact with a certain data type (e.g. a shape file)
You know the right driver to read or write data. Some drivers might only read content but the majority can read and write.

```{r, engine='python'}
try:
  from osgeo import ogr
except:
  import ogr
```

## Points

```{r, engine='python'}
from osgeo import ogr
# Create a point geometry
wkt = "POINT (173914.00 441864.00)"
pt = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt(wkt)
print(pt)
# print help(osgeo.ogr)
```

## Define a spatial reference

See http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/wgs-84/ 

```{r, engine='python'}
from osgeo import osr
##  spatial reference
spatialRef = osr.SpatialReference()
spatialRef.ImportFromEPSG(4326)  # from EPSG - Lat/long
```

## Reproject a point

```{r, engine = 'python'}
from osgeo import ogr
from osgeo import osr

## lat/long definition
source = osr.SpatialReference()
source.ImportFromEPSG(4326)

# http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6781/
# http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/28992/
target = osr.SpatialReference()
target.ImportFromEPSG(28992)

transform = osr.CoordinateTransformation(source, target)
point = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt("POINT (5.6660 -51.9872)")
point.Transform(transform)
print point.ExportToWkt()
```

## Create a shape file

**Concept:**

* A point is a type of geometry stored as a feature.
* A layer can have many features.
* A datasource can have many layers.
* [The driver saves the datasource in a specific format](http://gdal.org/ogr/ogr_formats.html).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Driver
    Datasource
        Layer
            Feature
                Geometry
                    Point
```

Start a new Python script within the `Python` console of QGIS:

You can set the working directory using:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
import os
os.chdir('pathtoyourworkingdirectory')
print os.getcwd()
```

Now you can continue (you do not need to repead the `import os` if you have already done so!). More info about the different OGR formats (http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html):

* Set spatial reference
* create shape file
* create layer
* create point
* Put point as a geometr inside a feature
* Put feature in a layer
* Flush

```{r, engine = 'python'}
## Loading the modules
import os
os.chdir('data')

## Loading osgeo
try:
  from osgeo import ogr, osr
  print 'Import of ogr and osr from osgeo worked.  Hurray!\n'
except:
  print 'Import of ogr and osr from osgeo failed\n\n'

## Is the ESRI Shapefile driver available?
driverName = "ESRI Shapefile"
drv = ogr.GetDriverByName( driverName )
if drv is None:
    print "%s driver not available.\n" % driverName
else:
    print  "%s driver IS available.\n" % driverName

## choose your own name
## make sure this layer does not exist in your 'data' folder
fn = "testing.shp"
layername = "anewlayer"

## Create shape file
ds = drv.CreateDataSource(fn)
print ds.GetRefCount()

# Set spatial reference
spatialReference = osr.SpatialReference()
spatialReference.ImportFromProj4('+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs')

# you can also do the following
# spatialReference.ImportFromEPSG(4326)

## Create Layer
layer=ds.CreateLayer(layername, spatialReference, ogr.wkbPoint)
## Now check your data folder and you will see that the file has been created!
## From now on it is not possible anymore to CreateDataSource with the same name
## in your workdirectory untill your remove the name.shp name.shx and name.dbf file.
print(layer.GetExtent())

## What is the geometry type???
## What does wkb mean??

## ok lets leave the pyramid top and start building the bottom,
## let's do points
## Create a point
point1 = ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)
point2 = ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)

## SetPoint(self, int point, double x, double y, double z = 0)
point1.SetPoint(0,1.0,1.0) 
point2.SetPoint(0,2.0,2.0)

## Actually we can do lots of things with points: 
## Export to other formats/representations:
print "KML file export"
print point2.ExportToKML()

## Buffering
buffer = point2.Buffer(4,4)
print buffer.Intersects(point1)

## More exports:
buffer.ExportToGML()

## Back to the pyramid, we still have no Feature
## Feature is defined from properties of the layer:e.g:

layerDefinition = layer.GetLayerDefn()
feature1 = ogr.Feature(layerDefinition)
feature2 = ogr.Feature(layerDefinition)

## Lets add the points to the feature
feature1.SetGeometry(point1)
feature2.SetGeometry(point2)

## Lets store the feature in a layer
layer.CreateFeature(feature1)
layer.CreateFeature(feature2)
print "The new extent"
print layer.GetExtent()

## So what is missing ????
## Saving the file, but OGR doesn't have a Save() option
## The shapefile is updated with all object structure 
## when the script finished of when it is destroyed, 
# if necessay SyncToDisk() maybe used

ds.Destroy()
## below the output is shown of the above Python script that is run in the terminal
```

From the terminal you can remove the created "testing.shp" and related files using:

```{r, engine='bash'}
echo "in the terminal you can use the following bash commands to easily remove files"
echo "list all the files starting with testing*"
ls data/testing*
echo "remove all the files starting with testing*"
rm -v data/testing*
```

Now, we can open the created shape file in QGIS using the following `python` code from the terminal:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
## add a vector layer to the QGIS interface
qgis.utils.iface.addVectorLayer(fn, layername, "ogr") 
aLayer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
print aLayer.name()
```

## Modify a shape file

Now let's try to add an extra point to the shape file:

```{r, engine='python', eval=FALSE}
ds = driver.Open(shp_file, 1)
## check layers and get the first layer
layernr = ds.GetLayerCount()
print layernr
layer = ds.GetLayerByIndex(0)
print layer

## get number of features in shapefile layer
features_number = layer.GetFeatureCount()
print "number of features for this layer:", features_number

## get the feature definition:
featureDefn = layer.GetLayerDefn()

## create a point
point = ogr.Geometry(ogr.wkbPoint)
point.SetPoint(0,2.0,1.0)
print point
## similarly 
## point.AddPoint(2,1)

## create a new feature
feature = ogr.Feature(featureDefn)
feature.SetGeometry(point)
# Lets store the feature in file
layer.CreateFeature(feature)
layer.GetExtent()
ds.Destroy()
```


## How to visualise a shape file? 

Open in QGIS

# Summary

Remember:

1. Get or create a writeable layer 2. Add fields if necessary
3. Create a feature
4. Populate the feature
5. Add the feature to the layer 6. Close the layer

# Assignment

Now create your own shape file containing one location (e.g. a location of the GAIA building in Wageningen). Go to Google Earth, extra the coordinates and redo the above excercise and export to KML. See here for the R version of creating a spatial point: https://geoscripting-wur.github.io/IntroToVector/. You can also use these points.

# More information

If you have time left you can start the following tutorial made by Prof. P. Lewis:
http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/geogg122/_build/html/Chapter4_GDAL/OGR_Python.html

<!---

# Assignment

Upload your Python script to Github (as a .py file) uploaded within the `Python` folder part of your repository for the Python week:
Create a script that:

- defines two points in Google Earth or use the two points from the R vector excercise.
- set the projection (Lat/Long, should you know now the EPSG) and reproject to the Dutch projection (See definition in the Vector Lesson)
- draw a line between the points
- create a buffer around the points of 100m
- measure the distance between these points (i.e. the distance of that line) and print it out.
- export the two point to shape file (that can be imported in QGIS)
